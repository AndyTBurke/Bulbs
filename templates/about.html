    <h2>Welcome to the BULBS web app!</h2>
    <div id="about-info" class="text-container">
    <p>This web app was developed as part of my <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/" class="external-link" target="_blank">CS50x</a> final project! The idea for this app was inspired by the course's <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/2/bulbs/" class="external-link" target="_blank">"Bulbs" homework assignment</a>. This web app is designed to help you transform text messages into captivating patterns of bulbs using binary code, providing <a href="/learn" class="external-link">an interactive learning experience</a> along the way.</p>

    <h2>Basic Functionality</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Input your text message:</strong> Simply enter the desired text into our user-friendly interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Conversion process:</strong> Behind the scenes, the Flask backend takes each character of your message and converts it into its corresponding unicode value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Binary encoding:</strong> The unicode values are then transformed into its binary representation, creating a unique binary message.
      </li>
    </ol>
  
    <h2>Decode Binary Messages</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to encoding text messages into binary patterns, this web app allows you to decode received binary messages back into plain text. If you have received a mesmerizing binary pattern, simply navigate to <a href="/decode" class="external-link">the Decode page</a> and input the binary message. Our app will convert it back into plain text.
    </p>
  
    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <p>
      My goal for this app is to make learning about binary code fun and accessible. I hope that visual representations and interactive experiences can enhance the learning process, enabling you to grasp complex concepts with ease. Whether you're a student, a technology enthusiast, or simply curious about binary, our web app is here to inspire and educate.
