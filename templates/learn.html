    <h1>ðŸ’¡ HOW IT WORKS ðŸ’¡</h1>
    <p class="sub-text">To understand how this app works, you need to understand two things: <strong>Binary</strong> and <strong>Unicode</strong></p>
    <div class="text-container">
        <h2>What is binary?</h2>
        <p>
            Binary is a way of counting or representing numbers using only two symbols: 0 and 1. 
            In our everyday decimal system (a.k.a. base-10), we have ten symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), but in binary, we use 
            just two symbols. It's like having a special code where the only numbers are 0 and 1. 
            We can think of it as a lightbulb being either off (âš«) or on (ðŸŸ¡).
        </p>
        <div class="interactive-learn-el">
            <h4>Count in binary</h4>
            <div>Binary (base-2) Value: 
                <div id="binary-counter">0</div>
            </div>
            <div>Decimal (base-10) Value: 
                <div id="decimal-counter">0</div>
            </div>
            <button id="counter-btn">+1</button>
        </div>

        <p>
            Computers use binary because they work with tiny switches called transistors. These transistors can be in two states: 
            off or on, which corresponds to the binary numbers 0 and 1. Since computers are made up of these switches, they 
            operate using binary numbers.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Unicode?</h2>
        <p>
            Binary numbers are great for computers, but what if we want to use letters, numbers, or symbols? That's where Unicode 
            comes in. Unicode is like a big dictionary that matches numbers with different characters. Unicode helps computers understand 
            and display all the different characters we use in our writing.
        </p>
        <div class="interactive-learn-el">
            <h4>Enter a letter or number to see its Unicode value</h4>
            <input id="unicode-converter" type="text" maxlength="1" /> Unicode decimal value: <div id="unicode-value">-</div>
        </div>
        <h2>So how does 'BULBS' work?</h2>
        <p>
            When you type in a message on the <a class="external-link" href="/">"text to binary"</a> page, that message gets sent to the server where each letter (or symbol 
            or number or emoji) is converted to its base-10 Unicode value. That base-10 value is then converted to its binary equivalent
            where it is output to your screen. On the <a class="external-link" href="/decode">"binary to text"</a> page, the same process happens in reverse.  It's a fun way to explore 
            and understand how binary and Unicode work together!
