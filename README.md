##### Basic Functionality
1. Input your text message: Simply enter the desired text into our user-friendly interface.
2. Conversion process: Behind the scenes, the Flask backend takes each character of your message and converts it into its corresponding unicode value.
3. Binary encoding: The unicode values are then transformed into its binary representation, creating a unique binary message.
4. Additionally, there is a "how it works" page that includes iteractive learning elements.

##### Technologies Used
- Flask: A Python web framework used for the backend development of Bulbs.
- Python: The primary programming language for the server-side logic and data processing.
- JavaScript: Used to handle interactive elements, dynamic updates, and client-side functionality.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for structuring the webpages and creating appealing visual designs.
- Jinja: A templating engine integrated with Flask for rendering dynamic content and data.

##### Goal
My goal for this app is to make learning about binary code fun and accessible. I hope that visual representations and interactive experiences can enhance the learning process, enabling you to grasp complex concepts with ease. Whether you're a student, a technology enthusiast, or simply curious about binary, our web app is here to inspire and educate.
